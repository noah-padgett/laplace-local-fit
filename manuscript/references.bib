@article{Bollen1995,
abstract = {Busemeyer and Jones (1983) and Kenny and Judd (1984) pro- posed methods to include interactions of latent variables in structural equation models (SEMs). Despite the value of these works, their methods are limited by the required distributional assumptions, by their complexity in implementation, and by the unknown distributions of the estimators. This paper pro- vides a framework for analyzing SEMs ("LISREL" models) that include nonlinear functions of latent or a mix of latent and observed variables in their equations. It permits such nonlinear functions in equations that are part of latent variable models or measurement models. I estimate the coefficient parameters with a two-stage least squares estimator that is consistent and asymp- totically normal with a known asymptotic covariance matrix. The observed random variables can come from nonnormal distributions. Several hypothetical cases and an empirical exam- ple illustrate the method},

abstract = {In this study, we introduce an interval estimation approach based on Bayesian structural equation modeling to evaluate factorial invariance. For each tested parameter, the size of noninvariance with an uncertainty interval (i.e. highest density interval [HDI]) is assessed via Bayesian parameter estimation. By comparing the most credible values (i.e. 95{\%} HDI) with a region of practical equivalence (ROPE), the Bayesian approach allows researchers to (1) support the null hypothesis of practical invariance, and (2) examine the practical importance of the noninvariant parameter. Compared to the traditional likelihood ratio test, simulation results suggested that the proposed Bayesian approach could offer additional insight into evaluating factorial invariance, thus, leading to more informative conclusions. We provide an empirical example to demonstrate the procedures necessary to implement the proposed method in applied research. The importance of and influences on the choice of an appropriate ROPE are discussed.},

abstract = {This article is concerned with measures of fit of a model. Two types of error involved in fitting a model are considered. The first is error of approximation which involves the fit of the model, with optimally chosen but unknown parameter values, to the population covariance matrix. The second is overall error which involves the fit of the model, with parameter values estimated from the sample, to the population covariance matrix. Measures of the two types of error are proposed and point and interval estimates of the measures are suggested. These measures take the number of parameters in the model into account in order to avoid penalizing parsimonious models. Practical difficulties associated with the usual tests of exact fit or a model are discussed and a test of “close fit” of a model is suggested. {\textcopyright} 1992, SAGE PERIODICALS PRESS.

CIs and tests of close fit based on the SRMR are generally accurate across all conditions (even at p = 60 with nonnormal data). In contrast, CIs and tests of close fit based on the RMSEA are only accurate in small models.

@article{Kaplan1989,
abstract = {This paper examines the problem of model modification in covariance structure analysis. Two methods of model modification are studied: the Modification Index (MI) which suggests modifications based on the largest drop in the overall value of the test statistic, and the Expected Parameter Change Statistic (EPC) which suggests modifications based on the removal of large and interesting specifications errors. Following a detailed discussion of the theory behind the MI and EPC, these methods are studied and applied to two specifications of the Wisconsin status attainment model. Additionally, a standardized version of the EPC statistic (SEPC) is proposed and applied to one of these models. Results indicate that the MI tends to suggest freeing substantively implausible parameters. The EPC and SEPC, by contrast, suggest freeing substantively interesting parameters. Results are discussed in terms of the practice of covariance structure modeling. {\textcopyright} 1989, Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {An analysis of empirical data often leads to a rejection of a hypothesized model, even if the researcher has spent considerable efforts in including all available information in the formulation of the model. Thus, the researcher must reformulate the model in some way, but in most instances there is, at least theoretically, an overwhelming number of possible actions that could be taken. In this paper a "modification index" will be discussed which should serve as a guide in the search for a "better" model. In statistical terms, the index measures how much we will be able to reduce the discrepancy between model and data, as defined by a general fit function, when one parameter is added or freed or when one equality constraint is relaxed. The modification index discussed in this paper is an improvement of the one incorporated in the LISREL V computer program in that it takes into account changes in all the parameters of the model when one particular parameter is freed. {\textcopyright} 1989 The Psychometric Society.},

@article{Chou1990,
abstract = {Model comparisons in covariance structure modeling have traditionally been carried out by the likelihood ratio difference (D) test. Two more convenient approaches are reviewed and evaluated. The Lagrange Multiplier (LM) test evaluates the impact of model modification from a more limited model whereas the Wald (W) test makes the evaluation from a more general model. The empirical performance of the D, LM, and W tests under null and alternative hypotheses are compared in this study. The results indicate that both new tests performed as well as the D test for reasonable sample sizes. The nonmonotonicity of power function for the W test was discovered; however, it is not severe in this study. The LM test behaved as a central or noncentral $\chi$2 variate under null or alternative hypotheses, as expected. However, when a correct null hypothesis was embedded in a composite hypothesis which was false, an incremental LM test tended to suggest more parameters than needed to be freed, especially at larger sample sizes. This incorrect behavior of the LM test was correctable by following up the LM test by a W test, that is, a combination of both LM and W tests seemed to provide a fairly satisfactory outcome in the process of model modification. {\textcopyright} 1990, Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.
